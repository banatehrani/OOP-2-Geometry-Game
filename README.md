### Object Oriented Programming App 2: Geometry Game

- **Description**: This app draws a random rectangle for which the coordinates of the
left bottom and top right points are randomly selected. Then the user guesses 
a random point and the area of the rectangle, and it is evaluated if the point is
inside the rectangle and how much the anticipated area is off. The point is drawn as
well.

- **Important**: It should be noted that it is important to specify the random coordinates of 
the corners of the rectangle in a way that point 1 specifies the bottom left and 
point 2 specifies the top right.
